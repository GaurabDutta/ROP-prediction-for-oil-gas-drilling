# ROP-prediction-for-oil-gas-drilling
Objective is to build a prediction model for rate of penetration (ROP) during oil &amp; gas drilling operations. Drilling wells in challenging operating environments implies large capital expenditure. To optimize drilling operations, real-time decisions are critical. Increasing the ROP may result in direct savings for the operator, thus the prediction of rate of penetration (ROP) with accuracy is essential.
